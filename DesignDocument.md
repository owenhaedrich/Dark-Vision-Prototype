## Design Pitch

Eyes adjusted for the dark is a double-edged sword! Can you use the dark to your advantage and survive being blinded by the light? 

## Design Rationale
Many horror and stealth games feature light based mechanics for sneaking around or not getting caught. However there are not any punishments beside the risk of capture for entering light. Can an overbearing negative scare players out of the light and make them feel comfortable treading through the darkness?

## Objective
We want to evaluate the player's response to intense transition between light and dark. We are attempting to simulate the experience of a creature whose eye cannot withstand the light, because we believe this could be the core mechanic in an innovative stealth game.

Objective Statement Question: *Does the player find the blinding light fearful and the returning darkness comforting?*

How does the transition between light and dark affect the player? Does entering the blinding light cause fear? Does returning to the darkness trigger comfort?

## Gameplay Overview
The player will be required to sneak through different settlements. Playing as a goblin like creature, light will cause the player character to be noticeably upset, and vision and sound will be greatly reduced. Avoiding the light where possible and sneaking through the light to get more valuable rewards will provide most of the challenge. Looting keys can get you further into the civilization for better loot and harder reward.

## Genre
Stealth, Action

## Target Audience
Gamers who enjoy atmospheric or stealth games.

## How is this project innovative?
This prototype explores a section of the horror and stealth genres that has remained stagnant for many years. While staying out of the light is crucial in many stealth games, it is not explored further beyond making the player character easier to spot. Using raycasts on the lights allow us see the strongest light source on the player at anytime, and interact with the player accordingly. With how the light sources are built, they are easily customizable for any situation that needs lighting. The system is reusable for any sort of light source, including spot lights or hand held torches.

## Future Game Features and Lore

### Level Design Possibilities
The game would take place in a generic fantasy style world. The main setting would be a large castle, featuring a keep, a bustling town, a rundown outer town and spread out farm houses in the plains and woods nearby. The level design would focus on well thoughtout layouts for houses and roads that will allow for the player to have many options when it comes to sneaking in and around.

### Enemy NPCs
Enemy NPCs would range in strength from peasents to guards to experienced monster hunters. If you attract too much attention, the city will pay these experienced hunters to track you down, while also increasing the amount of lights in the city.

### Story
Driven from your damp cave by your insatiable goblin greed, you start by preying on those in outer settlements. As your confidence and coffers grow, so does your greed. Push deeper and deeper into the light filled city, and find places to hide in during the day. Humans are known to hate goblinkind, so any sign of your rummaging could bring experienced monster hunters to track you down. In your rummaging you hear of the DragonStone - an endlessly valuable gem hidden in the keep in the centre of the castle...

### Character
A small, mean, green creature, you are as ugly as you are greedy. With no need for personal belongings beside your magical bag of holding, you are only interested in the shiniest of materials.

### Replayability
While a tightly knit and polished map experience will be needed for the game to shine, randomized loot and enemies spawns, as well as difficulty options, will allow players to continue to play the game for fun after experiencing the story for the first time.

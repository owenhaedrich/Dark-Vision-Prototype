## Design Pitch

Eyes adjusted for the dark is a double-edged sword! Can you use the dark to your advantage and survive being blinded by the light? 

## Design Rationale
Many horror and stealth games feature light based mechanics for sneaking around or not getting caught. However there are not any punishments beside the risk of capture for entering light. Can an overbearing negative scare players out of the dark and make them feel comfortable treading through the darkness?

## Objective
How does the transition between light and dark affect the player? Does entering the blinding light cause fear? Does returning to the darkness trigger comfort?

## Gameplay Overview
The player will be required to sneak through different settlements. Playing as a goblin like creature, light will cause the player character to be noticeably upset, and vision and sound will be greatly reduced. Avoiding the light where possible and sneaking through the light to get more valuable rewards will provide most of the challenge. Looting keys can get you further into the civilization for better loot and harder reward.

## Genre

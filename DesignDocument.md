## Design Pitch

Eyes adjusted for the dark is a double-edged sword! Can you use the dark to your advantage and survive being blinded by the light? 

---

## Primary Mechanics

### Dark Vision

See in extreme darkness.

### Blinding Lights

Lose you senses when overwhelmed by light.

### Audio and Visual Transitions

Experience emotional swings as you lose and regain your ability to perceive your surroundings.

---

## Objective

How does the transition between light and dark effect the player. Does entering the blinding light cause fear? Does returning to the darkness trigger comfort?
